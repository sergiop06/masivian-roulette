Test backend Masivian that represents a casino with multiple roulettes. A user can create roulette tables and place bets on each one of them.

When the user is finished placing all the bets, it can request for a roulette closure so the house will pick a winner number and give the corresponding money to the 
winner clients as well as substract the money from the credit of the looser clients.
